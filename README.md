## How its Made 💭

This game was rendered with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and used [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) for physics simulation.
For the highscore system, I used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Lore 🗿

Blow gusts of wind at the dear tumbleweed as to encourage it to traverse through day and night.
Must a tumbleweed need know its purpose?
Or will it be further disappointed?
This species of thought is uninteresting to the enthusiastic eye, yet necessary for its documentation in history by the ennuian.
Moonlight Tumble encourages the rare combination of existential thought and merry.

## Asset Showcase 👨‍🎨

I created many custom assets for this game because I was in a graphic design class at the time in my junior year of high school.
These include a wrapping/scrolling background and a character.
